## 🧠 Abstract / Overview

This project presents an **enhanced implementation of the Schnorr Signcryption scheme** for **black-and-white image encryption**.  
The system integrates **signature and encryption** in a single process to achieve **data confidentiality, authenticity, and computational efficiency**.

The goal is to explore how the Schnorr Signcryption mechanism can be effectively adapted to **binary image data**, with a focus on performance, key generation, and message reconstruction accuracy.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔒 **Integrated Signcryption:** Combines encryption and digital signature in one operation.  
- 🖼️ **Image-Based Encryption:** Supports black-and-white image inputs as messages.  
- ⚡ **Efficient Computation:** Optimized for lightweight image data processing.  
- 🔑 **Ephemeral Key Mechanism:** Introduces randomness for each session to enhance forward secrecy.  
- 📊 **Performance Analysis:** Includes runtime comparison and efficiency metrics.

## ⚙️ Methodology

1. **Image Preprocessing:** Convert black-and-white images into binary (0,1) and integer representations.  
2. **Key Generation:** Generate public and private key pairs.  
3. **Signcryption Phase:**  
   - Generate an ephemeral key.  
   - Compute ciphertext and digital signature simultaneously.  
4. **Unsigncryption Phase:**  
   - Verify signature authenticity.  
   - Decrypt the image data.  
5. **Reconstruction:** Convert decrypted integers back into black-and-white image format.
